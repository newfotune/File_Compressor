# File_Compressor- 
Like its name suggests, file Compressor is an application that helps compress files. It currently supports Text files and image files. It will soon support video files also. The back end is written in C/C++ with Qt used for the front-end. 
The application uses the Huffman encoding algorithm. If you want to use this software or part of the code, send me an email about (1) What part of the code you want. (2) What you want to use it for. After that, feel free to use as you want :)
Also feel free to send me an email about suggested features to add.
